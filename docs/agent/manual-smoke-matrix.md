# Manual Smoke Matrix

Automated tests do not cover every LLPlayer behavior. Use these manual checks when touching related areas.

## Playback

- Open a local video file.
- Open media from a command-line path/URL.
- Play, pause, seek, stop, change volume, fullscreen, and close.
- Confirm taskbar progress and play/pause thumbnail action update.

## Subtitles

- Load embedded text subtitles.
- Load external text subtitles.
- Load bitmap subtitles when relevant.
- Enable primary and secondary subtitles together.
- Use subtitle seek, sidebar current/previous/next behavior, and sidebar search.
- Confirm overlay subtitle placement, separator, sizing, and bitmap positioning.
- Place a sidecar subtitle file beside a video (e.g. `movie.ru.srt`, `movie.en.ass`), open the video, and confirm it is auto-detected and appears under External files with its language/source.
- Open the right-click Subtitles ▸ Subtitle Tracks menu and confirm BOTH Primary (1st) and Secondary (2nd) submenus list Embedded / External files / ASR; assign tracks to each slot.
- Open the sidebar "Subtitle tracks" quick switcher and confirm it lists embedded + external + ASR with language/source; assign ① primary / ② secondary and use per-slot Off; confirm the checked state follows the active selection.

## Sidebar And Word Actions

- Toggle sidebar, move it left/right, resize it.
- Use spoiler mask and original/translated toggles.
- Left-click a subtitle word and confirm word lookup pauses playback and opens/copies according to settings.
- Left-drag across subtitle words and confirm phrase lookup, including reverse-direction selection.
- Middle-click subtitle text and confirm sentence lookup.
- Right-click a subtitle word and confirm configured word actions/search/copy menu.
- Use the configured last-search modifier and confirm it opens the previous search action.
- Resume playback and confirm open word popups close.

## Translation

- Verify target language selection.
- Smoke the touched provider only.
- For LLM-like providers, check context-aware sequential behavior if changed.

## ASR/OCR

- Download/select model or engine through existing dialogs when changing download/settings code.
- Start ASR and cancel it.
- Run OCR on bitmap subtitles and cancel it.
- For Whisper/ASR native-runtime issues, check Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2022 or newer as a troubleshooting prerequisite.
- VC++ preflight (T-02): on a machine WITHOUT the x64 VC++ Redistributable, enable whisper.cpp ASR and confirm a non-blocking "INSTALL" snackbar opens the Microsoft download page instead of the app crashing; enable Tesseract OCR and confirm a clear "requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable" message (with the download URL) appears instead of a crash. Confirm faster-whisper ASR and Microsoft OCR are NOT gated by this check, and that with the runtime installed both ASR and OCR start normally.

## Batch Subtitles

- Open the batch subtitles dialog from the sidebar and from the context menu.
- Scan a local folder with multiple videos; repeat with recursive scan enabled.
- Run batch with whisper.cpp and faster-whisper on real media; confirm `video.ru.srt` is saved beside each completed video.
- Smoke a local LLM provider such as Ollama, LM Studio, KoboldCpp, or LiteLLM; confirm LLM keep-context translation stays ordered within each file.
- Cancel while ASR is running and while translation is running; confirm completed outputs remain and pending files do not start.
- Include a no-audio video and confirm it fails in the queue while later files continue.
- Open a generated `video.ru.srt` in LLPlayer and confirm playback/sidebar/subtitle UI still works.
- Restart LLPlayer and confirm batch last folder, recursive scan, and overwrite policy are restored.
- Start a batch run, then CLOSE the main video window: confirm the app does not quit, a tray icon appears showing overall progress, the batch keeps running, and `video.ru.srt` files still appear; double-click the tray icon (or pick Open) to bring the player back.
- Start a batch run, then close the BATCH window itself (X): confirm it does NOT prompt to cancel — instead the window hides to the tray and the run continues; reopen it via the tray "Batch subtitles…" menu and confirm progress advanced. With the batch idle (not running), closing the batch window closes it normally.
- With the player minimized to the tray, double-click a video row in the batch list and confirm the player reopens and plays that file (with its `video.ru.srt` picked up).
- Pick Quit from the tray (or App ▸ Exit App) while a batch is running and confirm the app exits without a close prompt and the tray icon is removed.
- Confirm the batch window's own taskbar button shows overall progress while running.
- While a file transcribes, confirm the live timing updates every second (the active file's "elapsed" ticks up and an approximate "~MM:SS left" ETA shows in the row + transcript pane; the summary shows a rough overall "~MM:SS left") — visibly moving even between ASR segments, including on the slower CPU fallback.
- With "Smooth (no ASR/translate overlap)" on, run a batch and confirm ASR and translation never run at the same time (status moves file-by-file: RunningASR → QueuedForTranslation → Translating → Saving → Completed → next file's RunningASR), and outputs are still correct.
- With faster-whisper (CUDA) and "Run ASR on CPU while I work" on, start a run and keep using the mouse/keyboard: confirm the next chunk runs on CPU (GPU frees; the dialog summary shows "ASR on CPU (you're active)" and the tray tooltip shows a "CPU …%" marker) while progress continues, and that it switches back to GPU after the idle threshold; the chunk in flight finishes on its current device, and the transcript/output is unaffected by the switch.

## Config

- Open Settings, change a setting, use `Close`, restart, confirm it was not persisted.
- Open Settings, change a setting, use `Save & Close`, restart, confirm it was persisted.
- Check key binding edit/apply/load workflows when shortcut code changes.
- In Settings Keys, add/clone/delete a row, capture a key, commit with Enter, create and clear a duplicate, confirm Apply is blocked only while duplicates exist.
- Open CheatSheet with F1, switch Keyboard/Mouse tabs, search by shortcut/description, and execute an action button.
- On a fresh config (no `LLPlayer.Config.json`), confirm the Win11 Mica backdrop is on by default (Settings ▸ Themes shows it checked); toggle it off, `Save & Close`, restart, and confirm it stays off (the migration does not re-enable a saved-off value). On Windows 10 confirm the app still launches normally (Mica no-ops).

## Dubbing

- First-run provisioning UX: confirm the user opts in before local TTS engine/model setup and no model weights are committed.
- Start a dubbing batch on real media and confirm ASR -> translate -> save SRT -> dub -> completed runs serially when `GenerateDubbing=true`.
- Run a multi-file dubbing batch and confirm the local sidecar/model is started once for the run, then stopped at the end.
- Kill/cancel during dubbing and confirm no orphan Python process remains, VRAM is released, and no partial `video.ru.dub.*` output remains.
- Open a video with an existing non-empty `video.ru.dub.flac`; confirm it appears under Audio ▸ External and plays in sync at 0:00, mid-video, and near the end.
- Re-run batch with an existing `video.ru.srt` but no `video.ru.dub.*`; confirm the default run renders the dub from the existing SRT without re-running ASR/translation.
- Ear-test CosyVoice2 Russian on real content: voice is Russian, ducking is audible, and the original audio remains present.
- Launch the published `.exe` on the target RTX 5090 machine with `GenerateDubbing=false`, then run one mock/real dubbing smoke if the local engine is provisioned.

## Packaging

- Run `scripts/codex/ship.ps1`.
- Confirm publish output contains `LLPlayer.exe`, `LLPlayer/lib/7z.dll`, copied `FFmpeg`, `Plugins/YoutubeDL/YoutubeDL.dll`, and `YoutubeDL.pdb`.
- Confirm publish output contains committed dubbing sidecar source (`dub_sidecar/server.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `README.md`) and does not contain dubbing runtime/model/output artifacts (`DubEngine`, `dubmodels`, `*.ru.dub.*`).
- Do not require network download of `yt-dlp.exe` for local smoke unless explicitly shipping a release.
